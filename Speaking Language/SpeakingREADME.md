# Welcome to the Speaking Language!

This project was created by Eric Wang as part of the Honors Programming Languages curriculum of Spring 2021

## Introduction
The speaking language is primarily designed to more resemble normal speaking compared to traditional coding languages such as Java

## The Basics

### General Syntax
Similar to the semicolon `;` used in Java, Speaking uses the period `.`
Braces `{ }` used in Java will also be used in Speaking.

Additionally, "and" will be used instead of commas to separate elements.

To comment, begin with "btw, ".
For multiple lines of comments, begin with "psst, " and end with "alright?"
Example:

```
btw, I am commenting right now.

psst, 
This is another way to comment.
alright?
```
### Variables
Speaking supports integers, doubles, booleans, and Strings, but they are called "numbers", "decimals", "facts", and "Words", respectively.

When declaring variables, use "The" + [variable type] + [variable name]. To set the variable, simply use "is" + [definition]


Example:
```
the Word testVariable.
testVariable is "Hello".

The Word testVariable2 is "Hello".
```
To call a variable, simply use the variable name:

`announce testVariable.`

### Functions
In general, functions follow the form "My function" + [function name] + "accepts" + ([function parameter(s)]) + "and distributes" + [return type(s)] + "."

Example:
```
My function testFunction accepts (integer)
```

Although functions can only return one element at a time, they can have multiple return types (**subject to change if not possible**)



### Control Flow
The Speaking Language mainly uses 2 loops: `while` and`until`.
`while` works like the while loop in Java, and `until` runs until the conditions are met.

Use [loop type] + ([conditions]).

Example: 
```
number x is 2.
while(x is 2){
    announce x.
}
```
### Operators
Operators in Speaking serve the same purpose as Java's operators, but with different names:
|Java Operator|Speaking Operator|
|--|--|
|>|is greater than|
|<|is less than|
|>=|is greater than or equal to|
|<=|is less than or equal to|
|+|plus|
|-|minus|
|*|times|
|/|divided by|
|%|modulus|


### Misc.
More functions will be introduced over time when necessary.

### Important Table
